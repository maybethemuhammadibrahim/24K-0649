Ask the user for the nth number 
Ask the user for the n number

Check if the remainder by the division of n number by nth number is 0, by using modulus operator, if this is true then display that nth number is the divisor of n and goto next step otherwise display that the nth number is not the divisor of n number and end the program(This includes nth being zero).

Check if the remainder of nth divided by 2 is 0, by using modulus, if this is true display that the nth number is even. Otherwise check that whether the remainder of nth divided by 2 is 1, if this is true display that number is odd. If none of this is true display that zero cannot be checked for even or odd.
