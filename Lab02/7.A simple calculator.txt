Algorithm and Pseudocode for a simple console calculator
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm:
Ask the user for the first number
Ask the user for the operation (+,-,*,/)
Ask the user for the second number
Check if operation is equal to "+" , if this is true then continue this step, if not true then skip to next step
	let Sum = first number + second number
	Display "Sum"
Check if operation is equal to "-" , if this is true then continue this step, if not true then skip to next step
	let Difference = first number - second number 
	Display "Difference"
Check if operation is equal to "*" , if this is true then continue this step, if not true then skip to next step
	let Product = first number * second number
	Display "Product"
Check if operation is equal to "/" , if this is true then continue this step, if not true then skip to next step
	let Fraction = first number / second number
	Display "Fraction"
If none of the conditions are met ask the user to Re-enter the operator


Pseudocode:
Start
Input firstno
Input operator
Input secondno

If operator == "+" Then
	let sum = firstno + secondno
	Print sum

Else if operator == "-" Then
	let diff = firstno - secondno
	Print diff

Else if operator == "*" Then
	let product = firstno * secondno
	Print product

Else if operator == "/" Then
	let frac = firstno / secondno
	Print frac
Else 
	Print "Please Re-Enter the operator (+,-,*,/)"

End
